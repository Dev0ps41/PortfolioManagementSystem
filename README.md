PortfolioManagment system
‚úî Store & manage investment records in a SQL Server database.
‚úî Provide API endpoints for retrieving, adding, and deleting investments.
‚úî Use Entity Framework Core for seamless database management.
‚úî Swagger UI for easy API testing.
‚úî Future-proof design with authentication & stock data integration planned.
+ React.js Frontend + Tailwind css + Integrating Stock Market Data into the Portfolio Management System (free Alpha Vantage api)

How It Works (Flow)
1 User enters investment details (ticker, shares, price, date).
2 React sends a POST request to /api/Portfolio/AddInvestment.
3 ASP.NET Core saves the data in the SQL Server database.
4 Response sent back confirming success or failure.


Portfolio Management System (Backend) - Features & Functionality
This ASP.NET Core Web API project serves as the backend for a Portfolio Management System, allowing users to manage their investments. It provides functionalities such as storing investments in a database, retrieving portfolio details, adding new investments, and deleting investments.

1. Features of the Backend System
 User Investment Management
The API allows users to:
 Add new investments (e.g., buying stocks).
 Retrieve all investments for a specific user.
 Delete an investment from the portfolio.
 
2. Backend Architecture Overview
The system follows a structured architecture using ASP.NET Core Web API with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and SQL Server for data storage.

 Technologies Used:

ASP.NET Core Web API --> Backend framework
Entity Framework Core --> ORM for database interaction
SQL Server ‚Üí Database storage
Swagger ‚Üí API testing interface
JWT (Planned) ‚Üí Secure authentication
React.js Frontend + Tailwind css 
Integrating Stock Market Data into the Portfolio Management System (free Alpha Vantage api)

3. Detailed Explanation of Each Component
 Step 1: Project Setup
The project is created using ASP.NET Core Web API.
Required dependencies such as Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, and Newtonsoft.Json are installed.
 Step 2: Database Configuration
The connection to the SQL Server database is set up inside appsettings.json:

json

"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=PortfolioDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
 What this does:
This ensures the API can connect to the SQL Server database named PortfolioDB.

 Step 3: Database Models & DbContext
A C# model (Investment.cs) is created to represent investment records:

csharp

public class Investment
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string Ticker { get; set; }
    public int Shares { get; set; }
    public decimal PurchasePrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime PurchaseDate { get; set; }
}
 What this does:
This defines the data structure, including:

Id ‚Üí Unique identifier for each investment.
UserId ‚Üí Identifies the user who owns the investment.
Ticker ‚Üí The stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla).
Shares ‚Üí Number of shares owned.
PurchasePrice ‚Üí The price at which the shares were bought.
PurchaseDate ‚Üí The date of purchase.
üîπ Step 4: Database Context
A DbContext (PortfolioDbContext) is used for database operations:

csharp

public class PortfolioDbContext : DbContext
{
    public PortfolioDbContext(DbContextOptions<PortfolioDbContext> options) : base(options) { }
    public DbSet<Investment> Investments { get; set; }
}
 What this does:

Defines the Investments table in the database.
Allows interaction with the database using EF Core.
 Step 5: API Controllers
The API exposes endpoints for managing investments via the PortfolioController.

‚úîÔ∏è Get Portfolio by User
 Endpoint: GET /api/Portfolio/GetPortfolio/{userId}
 What it does: Returns all investments for a given userId.

csharp

[HttpGet("GetPortfolio/{userId}")]
public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Investment>>> GetPortfolio(string userId)
{
    return await _context.Investments.Where(i => i.UserId == userId).ToListAsync();
}
‚úîÔ∏è Add a New Investment
 Endpoint: POST /api/Portfolio/AddInvestment
 What it does: Adds a new investment record.

csharp

[HttpPost("AddInvestment")]
public async Task<ActionResult> AddInvestment(Investment investment)
{
    _context.Investments.Add(investment);
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    return Ok();
}

 Delete an Investment
 Endpoint: DELETE /api/Portfolio/DeleteInvestment/{id}
 What it does: Deletes an investment by ID.

csharp

[HttpDelete("DeleteInvestment/{id}")]
public async Task<ActionResult> DeleteInvestment(int id)
{
    var investment = await _context.Investments.FindAsync(id);
    if (investment == null) return NotFound();
    _context.Investments.Remove(investment);
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    return Ok();
}
 Step 6: Running Database Migrations
 What this does:
Creates the database schema automatically.

powershell

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
 Step 7: API Testing with Swagger
Once the application is running (F5 in Visual Studio), you can test the API endpoints in Swagger at:
 http://localhost:5000/swagger

Available API Endpoints in Swagger
GET /api/Portfolio/GetPortfolio/{userId} ‚Üí Fetch user‚Äôs investments.
POST /api/Portfolio/AddInvestment ‚Üí Add new investment.
DELETE /api/Portfolio/DeleteInvestment/{id} ‚Üí Remove investment.
